# Obsidian Substack Copy

One-click copy for Substack publishing.

This plugin converts your Markdown article into Substack-compatible HTML, automatically resolving and embedding local images as Base64 data. This allows you to paste directly into the Substack editor with images included, bypassing the need for manual image uploads.

## Features

- **Zero Config**: Just install and run the command.
- **Image Embedding**: Automatically finds local images referenced in your note and embeds them as Base64.
- **Format Preservation**: Uses Obsidian's core Markdown engine to preserve your formatting (bold, lists, etc.).

## How to Use

1. Open a note in Obsidian.
2. Select text (or select nothing to copy the entire file).
3. Run command: `Substack Copy: Copy for Substack`.
4. Paste into Substack.
